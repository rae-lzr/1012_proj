Specifically, we're seeking the prompt or instruction used in the [Gemma 7B-it](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma/frameworks/pyTorch/variations/7b-it-quant) model to convert one text to another. Typically, large language models are instructed to transform one text to another style, but here we're tasked with the inverse: finding the instruction/prompt used for the transformation. This notebook walks you through fine-tuning the **Gemma 2b-it** model with LoRA for this prompt recovery task using KerasNLP. Witih KerasNLP, we can fine-tune with LoRA using just a few lines of code.\n\n**Fun fact**: This notebook is backend-agnostic, supporting TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX. However, the best performance can be achieved with `JAX`. KerasNLP and Keras enable the choice of preferred backend.

This process starts with tokenization, where input strings are converted into sequences of token IDs.\n\n**Why it's important:** Initially, raw text data is complex and challenging for modeling due to its high dimensionality. By converting text into a compact set of tokens, such as transforming `\"The quick brown fox\"` into `[\"the\", \"qu\", \"##ick\", \"br\", \"##own\", \"fox\"]`, we simplify the data. Many models rely on special tokens and additional tensors to understand input. These tokens help divide input and identify padding, among other tasks.

It involves freezing the weights of the LLM and injecting trainable rank-decomposition matrices.\n\nImagine in an LLM, we have a pre-trained dense layer, represented by a $d \\times d$ weight matrix, denoted as $W_0$. We then initialize two additional dense layers, labeled as $A$ and $B$, with shapes $d \\times r$ and $r \\times d$, respectively. Here, $r$ denotes the rank, which is typically **much smaller than** $d$. Prior to LoRA, the model's output was computed using the equation $output = W_0 \\cdot x + b_0$, where $x$ represents the input and $b_0$ denotes the bias term associated with the original dense layer, which remains frozen. After applying LoRA, the equation becomes $output = (W_0 \\cdot x + b_0) + (B \\cdot A \\cdot x)$, where $A$ and $B$ denote the trainable rank-decomposition matrices that have been introduced.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/DWsbhLg/LoRA.png\" width=\"300\"><br/>\nCredit: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685\">LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models</a> Paper</center>\n\n\nIn the LoRA paper, $A$ is initialized with $\\mathcal{N} (0, \\sigma^2)$ and $B$ with $0$, where $\\mathcal{N}$ denotes the normal distribution, and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance.\n\n**Why does LoRA save memory?**\n\nEven though we're adding more layers to the model with LoRA, it actually helps save memory. This is because the smaller layers (A and B) have fewer parameters to learn compared to the big model and fewer trainable parameters mean fewer optimizer variables to store. So, even though the overall model might seem bigger, it's actually more efficient in terms of memory usage. \n\n> This notebook uses a LoRA rank of `4`. A higher rank means more detailed changes are possible, but also means more trainable parameters.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Enable LoRA for the model and set the LoRA rank to 4.\ngemma_lm.backbone.enable_lora(rank=4)\ngemma_lm.summary()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Notice** that, the number of trainable parameters is reduced from ~$2.5$ billions to ~$1.3$ millions after enabling LoRA.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Training","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Limit the input sequence length to 512 (to control memory usage).\ngemma_lm.preprocessor.sequence_length = CFG.sequence_length \n\n# Compile the model with loss, optimizer, and metric\ngemma_lm.compile(\n    loss=keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),\n    optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=3e-5),\n    weighted_metrics=[keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy()],\n)\n\n# Train model\ngemma_lm.fit(data, epochs=CFG.epochs, batch_size=CFG.batch_size)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Inference after fine-tuning\n\nLet's see how our fine-tuned model responds to the same questions we asked before fine-tuning the model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sample 1","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Take one sample\nrow = df.iloc[10]\n\n# Generate Prompt using template\nprompt = template.format(\n    original_text=row.original_text,\n    rewritten_text=row.rewritten_text,\n    rewrite_prompt=\"\",\n)\n\n# Infer\noutput = gemma_lm.generate(prompt, max_length=512)\n\n# Colorize\noutput = colorize_text(output)\n\n# Display in markdown\ndisplay(Markdown(output))","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sample 2","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Take one sample\nrow = df.iloc[20]\n\n# Generate Prompt using template\nprompt = template.format(\n    original_text=row.original_text,\n    rewritten_text=row.rewritten_text,\n    rewrite_prompt=\"\",\n)\n\n# Infer\noutput = gemma_lm.generate(prompt, max_length=512)\n\n# Colorize\noutput = colorize_text(output)\n\n# Display in markdown\ndisplay(Markdown(output))\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Test Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"test_df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/llm-prompt-recovery/test.csv\")\ntest_df['original_text'] = test_df['original_text'].fillna(\"\")\ntest_df['rewritten_text'] = test_df['rewritten_text'].fillna(\"\")\ntest_df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-08T19:26:54.434613Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-08T19:26:54.43503Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-08T19:26:54.448795Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-08T19:26:54.434999Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-08T19:26:54.447604Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Test Sample\n\nNow, let's try out a sample from test data that model hasn't seen during training.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"row = test_df.iloc[0]\n\n# Generate Prompt using template\nprompt = template.format(\n    original_text=row.original_text,\n    rewritten_text=row.rewritten_text,\n    rewrite_prompt=\"\",\n)\n\n# Infer\noutput = gemma_lm.generate(prompt, max_length=512)\n\n# Colorize\noutput = colorize_text(output)\n\n# Display in markdown\ndisplay(Markdown(output))","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-08T19:27:29.022534Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-08T19:27:29.023234Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-08T19:27:30.390404Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-08T19:27:29.023199Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-08T19:27:30.389393Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Submission","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"preds = []\nfor i in tqdm(range(len(test_df))):\n    row = test_df.iloc[i]\n\n    #
