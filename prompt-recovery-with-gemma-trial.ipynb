Specifically, we're seeking the prompt or instruction used in the [Gemma 7B-it](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma/frameworks/pyTorch/variations/7b-it-quant) model to convert one text to another. Typically, large language models are instructed to transform one text to another style, but here we're tasked with the inverse: finding the instruction/prompt used for the transformation. This notebook walks you through fine-tuning the **Gemma 2b-it** model with LoRA for this prompt recovery task using KerasNLP. Witih KerasNLP, we can fine-tune with LoRA using just a few lines of code.\n","\n","**Fun fact**: This notebook is backend-agnostic, supporting TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX.

Here, $r$ denotes the rank, which is typically **much smaller than** $d$. Prior to LoRA, the model's output was computed using the equation $output = W_0 \\cdot x + b_0$, where $x$ represents the input and $b_0$ denotes the bias term associated with the original dense layer, which remains frozen. After applying LoRA, the equation becomes $output = (W_0 \\cdot x + b_0) + (B \\cdot A \\cdot x)$, where $A$ and $B$ denote the trainable rank-decomposition matrices that have been introduced.\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/DWsbhLg/LoRA.png\" width=\"300\"><br/>\n","Credit: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685\">LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models</a> Paper</center>\n","\n","\n","In the LoRA paper, $A$ is initialized with $\\mathcal{N} (0, \\sigma^2)$ and $B$ with $0$, where $\\mathcal{N}$ denotes the normal distribution, and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance.\n","\n","**Why does LoRA save memory?**\n","\n","Even though we're adding more layers to the model with LoRA, it actually helps save memory. This is because the smaller layers (A and B) have fewer parameters to learn compared to the big model and fewer trainable parameters mean fewer optimizer variables to store.
